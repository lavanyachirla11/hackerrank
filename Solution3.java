9
No
Hello Java
Explanation 0

String  is "hello" and  is "java".

 has a length of , and  has a length of ; the sum of their lengths is .
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore,  is not greater than  and the answer is No.

When you capitalize the first letter of both  and  and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
